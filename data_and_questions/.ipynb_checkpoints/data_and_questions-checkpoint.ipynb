    "The marketing dataset is a dataset collected in the context of A/B testing where marketing companies want to run an ad campaign inplace of a Public Service Announcement. They want to test whether the campaign is successful. To test that, random experimentation is done and data of 588101 people are collected where majority of the people are exposed to the ad and the rest are exposed to a Public Service Announcement that is placed in the same place as the ad. A converted variable is recorded which indicates whether the person bought the product the ad was advertising or not. Three other additional variables such as the total ads seen by a person, the day the the person saw the most amount of ads and the hour of the day the person saw the most amount of ads were also recorded."
